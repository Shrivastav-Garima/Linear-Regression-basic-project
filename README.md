# Linear-Regression-basic-project
This mini project is aimed to predict the salary of a person on the basis of some considerable factors,using Linear Regression.
# Tools Used
# 1.Libraries : 
pandas,scikit-learn,matplotlib,seaborn
# 2.Dataset :
Dataset is loaded from Kaggle.
# Description
1.Dataset is loaded (in csv-format) from Kaggle and read using the pandas library.

2.The data is preprocessed before training the model.This includes handling missing values,outliers,inconsistent entries and encoding categorical variables(e.g., education levels or job titles).

3.Build the linear regression model:

->import the model using sklearn.

->Apply train-test split.

->Train and evaluate the model

4.You can also visualize the model using matplotlib for scatter-plot and seaborn for graphs.
